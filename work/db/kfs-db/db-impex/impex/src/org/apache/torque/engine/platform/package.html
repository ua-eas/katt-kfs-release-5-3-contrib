This package contains classes that provide compatibility to a range of RDBM platforms.
<p>
The <code>Platform</code> interface provides callbacks that allow to get
RDBMS Platform specific information whereever neccessary.

<p>
The class <code>PlatformDefaultImpl</code> implements <code>Platform</code> and
provides default implementations of all methods.

<p>
For each supported Platform <code>Xxx</code> there is a class <code>PlatformXxxImpl</code>
which extends <code>PlatformDefaultImpl</code> and may override the methods of the
baseclass.

<p>
The factory class <code>PlatformFactory</code> can be used to create <code>Platform</code>
instances.
