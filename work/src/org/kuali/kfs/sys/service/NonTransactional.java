/** 
 * This annotation is effectively a marker.  Beans which access data should 
 * either be Transactional or not.  To ensure that the developer has considered
 * this when writing service beans, the public mehtods of the service must be 
 * annotated as either Transactional or NonTransactional.  If the class is 
 * annotated, then it is assumed that all of the methods have that annotation
 * and no method internal to the class should have a Transactional/NonTransactional
 * annotation.  Since Spring provides the Transactional annotation, it is only
 * necessary to provide the NonTransactional annotation inside KFS.
 * 
 * This annotation has no effect in the application at runtime.  It is only used
 * by unit tests which seek to enforce/confirm that the preceeding policy is
 * being applied.
