/**
 * This class is the batch step used to delete pending attachments that have not yet been associated with a document. When
 * attachments are attached to docs in an "initiated" state, the attachment is not considered to be linked with the doc in the
 * persistence layer, and so it becomes a "pending" attachment (i.e. pending persistence). When docs are saved (or submitted, etc.),
 * pending attachments become permanently persisted to the document and are no longer pending. Pending attachments may have become
 * orphaned from the document (because the doc has not been saved), and so these orphaned attachments must be deleted. This job uses
 * the file's last modified time to determine which pending attachments should be deleted. If the modified time is older than the
 * SYSTEM parameter "pendingAssignmentMaxAge", then it will be deleted.
