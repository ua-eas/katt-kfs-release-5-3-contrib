 * This class is intended to be used for inverting all the boolean values stored in the database before loading them into the
 * business object and vice versa. This functionality is necessary for situations where a database table stores the opposite of the
 * intented boolean attribute. An example is where a given business object has a pre-defined attribute, such as "inactive", while
 * the user wishes to display the value as an 'active' indicator rather than an 'inactive indicator. Ideally, it would be better to
 * replace the field in the database with the appropriate representation of the data so we do not have to perform these confusing
 * conversions on data. Unfortunately, this is not always an option.
